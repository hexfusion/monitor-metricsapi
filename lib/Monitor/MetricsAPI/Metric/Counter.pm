=head1 NAME

Monitor::MetricsAPI::Metric::Counter - Counter metric class for Monitor::MetricsAPI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Monitor::MetricsAPI;

    my $collector = Monitor::MetricsAPI->new(
        metrics => { messages => { incoming => 'counter' } }
    );

    # Later on, when a new message is received by your app:
    $collector->metric('messages/incoming')->increment;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Counter metrics are numeric values which initialize at zero and only increase
over the lifetime of the monitored process. Counter metrics are appropriate
when you simply want to know how many times I<X> occurred.

=cut

sub BUILD {
    my ($self) = @_;

    $self->_set_value(0);
}

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are specific to counter metrics. L<Monitor::MetricsAPI::Metric>
defines methods which are common to all metric types.

=head2 add ($amount)

Adds $amount to the current value of the metric.

=cut

sub add {
    my ($self, $amount) = @_;

    return $self->_set_value(($self->_has_value ? $self->value : 0) + $amount);
}

=head2 increment

Increases the value of the metric by 1 each time it is called. Produces the
same effect as calling $metric->add(1), which is unsurprising since that is exactly
what this method does.

=cut

sub increment {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->add(1);
}
