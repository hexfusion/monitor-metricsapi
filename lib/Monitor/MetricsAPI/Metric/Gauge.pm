=head1 NAME

Monitor::MetricsAPI::Metric::Gauge - Gauge metric class for Monitor::MetricsAPI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Monitor::MetricsAPI;

    my $collector = Monitor::MetricsAPI->new(
        metrics => { process => { threads => 'gauge' } }
    );

    # Later on, when your application modifies its worker thread pool:
    $collector->metric('process/threads')->set(4);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gauge counters are numeric metrics providing an arbitrary point-in-time value.
Gauges may increase and decrease, and may do either by varying amounts each
time. They are useful for tracking things like current memory usage, number of
child threads or processes, temperature of a sensor, and any other arbitrary
values of interest.

All gauges are initialized at zero, but may be set to any numeric value even
negative values.
