=head1 NAME

Monitor::MetricsAPI::Server::Routes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You should not interact with this module directly in your code. Please refer to
L<Monitor::MetricsAPI> for how to integrate this service with your application.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The base Dancer2 application which provides HTTP API routes for MetricsAPI.

=cut

=head1 ROUTES

The following routes are provided by this server for viewing the collected
metrics.

=cut

=head2 /

Returns a small JSON structure with metadata about the metrics collector. May
be used as a heartbeat for the service, as it performs no computations and does
not invoke any metrics callbacks.

=cut

get '/' => sub {
    return {
        status  => 'ok',
        message => 'Metrics service alive.',
        service => _service_info(),
    };
};

=head2 /all

Returns a full export of all metrics that have been configured in the
containing application. This will include the invoking of all callback metrics.
Depending on your metrics collection, this can be a computationally expensive
process.

If you have any non-trivial callback metrics collected by your application, you
should exercise care in your calls to this route.

=cut

get '/all' => sub {
    my $coll = Monitor::MetricsAPI->collector;

    return {
        status  => 'collector_fail',
        message => 'Could not access metrics collector.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless defined $coll;

    return {
        status  => 'no_metrics',
        message => 'The collector does not have any metrics defined.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless scalar(keys(%{$coll->metrics})) > 0;

    return {
        status  => 'ok',
        message => 'Request processed successfully.',
        service => _service_info(),
        metrics => _expand_metrics(values %{$coll->metrics}),
    };
};

=head2 /metric/**

Returns a single named metric, instead of the entire collection of metrics. The
use of this route is substantially preferred for monitoring systems which use
checks against individual metrics, as it limits the invocations of potentially
expensive callback metrics (assuming your application configures any).

A complete metric name must be provided. For returning groups of metrics under
a common namespace, use the /metrics/ route instead.

=cut

get '/metric/**' => sub {
    my ($mparts) = splat;

    my $coll = Monitor::MetricsAPI->collector;
    my $metric_name = join('/', @{$mparts});

    return {
        status  => 'collector_fail',
        message => 'Could not access metrics collector.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless defined $coll;

    return {
        status  => 'not_found',
        message => 'Invalid metric name provided.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless exists $coll->metrics->{$metric_name};

    return {
        status  => 'ok',
        message => 'Request processed successfully.',
        service => _service_info(),
        metrics => _expand_metrics($coll->metric($metric_name)),
    };
};

=head2 /metrics/**

Returns a collection of metrics under the given namespace. Each component of
the namespace prefix you wish to return must be fully specified, but you can
select as deep or as shallow a namespace as you like. In other words, if you
have the following metrics:

    messages/incoming/total
    messages/incoming/rejected
    messages/outgoing/total
    messages/outgoing/supressed
    users/total

And your monitoring application calls this service with the following path:

    /metrics/messages/outgoing

Then this route will return two metrics:

    messages/outgoing/total
    messages/outgoing/supressed

But if you try to call this service with:

    /metrics/messages/out

You will receive an error response.

If you specify the full name of a single metric, you will receive only that
metric back in the response output. Given that, why would you ever use the
"/metric/**" route over this one? Using the single-metric route when you truly
only want a single metric will return an error if the name you give is a
namespace instead of a single metric. It is possible this may be useful in
some circumstances.

=cut

get '/metrics/**' => sub {
    my ($nsparts) = splat;

    my $coll = Monitor::MetricsAPI->collector;
    my $prefix = join('/', @{$nsparts});

    return {
        status  => 'collector_fail',
        message => 'Could not access metrics collector.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless defined $coll;

    return {
        status  => 'no_group',
        message => 'Must provide metric group prefix.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless defined $prefix && $prefix =~ m{\w+};

    my @metrics =
        map { $coll->metric($_) }
        grep { $_ =~ m{^$prefix(/|$)} }
        keys %{$coll->metrics};

    return {
        status  => 'not_found',
        message => 'Invalid metric group name provided.',
        service => _service_info(),
    } unless @metrics > 0;

    return {
        status  => 'ok',
        message => 'Request processed successfully.',
        service => _service_info(),
        metrics => _expand_metrics(@metrics),
    };
};

sub _expand_metrics {
    my (@metrics) = @_;

    my %m;

    foreach my $metric (@metrics) {
        my @path = split(m|/|, $metric->name);
        my $name = pop @path;
        my $val = $metric->value;
        my $key = \%m;
        foreach my $part (@path) {
            $key->{$part} = {} unless exists $key->{$part};
            $key = $key->{$part};
        }
        $key->{$name} = $val;
    }

    return \%m;
}

sub _service_info {
    return {
        name    => 'Monitor::MetricsAPI',
        version => $Monitor::MetricsAPI::VERSION,
    };
}

=head1 OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Unless otherwise noted, all routes return a similar data structure to the one
described in this section.

=head2 Complete Example

    { "status": "ok",
      "message: "Request processed successfully.",
      "service": {
        "name": "Monitor::MetricsAPI",
        "version": "0.001",
      },
      "metrics": {
        "messages": {
          "incoming": {
            "total": 5019,
            "rejected": 104
          },
          "outgoing": {
            "total": 1627,
            "suppressed": 5
          },
        },
        "users": {
          "total": 1928
        }
      }
    }

=head2 Status

The status attribute is present in every response, and anything other than the
string "ok" indicates an error condition. Responses with a non-"ok" status may
not contain any additional attributes beyond a message which will contain an
error message.

Note that the API server will still return an HTTP status code of 200 even when
there is an error displaying your metrics (e.g. you have requested a metric
which does not exist). The HTTP status codes are used only for indicating
whether the HTTP server itself is functioning properly and is able to process
the incoming HTTP request. HTTP status codes are not overloaded to also serve
as indicators of metrics "health."

=head2 Message

Contains a human-readable message, useful for discerning the reason for failed
requests. Otherwise easily ignored.

=head2 Service

The value of the service attribute is an object containing metadata about the
metrics reporting service.

=head2 Metrics

The metrics attribute contains an object of all metrics which matched the
request, nested according to the categories you used when defining your
metrics. In the case of requests to the "/all" route, this will be every metric
collected by the service for your application. For both the "/metric" and
"/metrics" routes, only those metrics which matched your request will appear in
the object, and all others will be omitted from the output. Callback metrics
which are not present in the API output are not invoked when constructing the
response.

The data type of each metric's value will depend on the type of metric that is
being collected. Counters and gauges will return numbers, boolean metrics will
return 1 (true), 0 (false), or null, and string metrics will return, well,
strings. Callback metrics can return any type, entirely dependent upon what the
subroutine you provided for the callback does. List metrics will return an
array containing values of whatever type was push()'ed onto the list within
your application.
